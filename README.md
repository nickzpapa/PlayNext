Keeps track of the next episode so you never have to remember which episode you left off.
Install:
  Place the executable in a directory with video/audio/etc files 
Running this program will:
  - **Launch the next episode** using the default program for the file
  - **Save where you left off** whether it's the 2nd episode or the 11th after binging 10 episodes the night before.
